This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

You can find an example of this project running at [my Github Pages](https://shadowtime2000.github.io/dev-blog).

All this does is use the DEV API to find your posts and it then lists them.
